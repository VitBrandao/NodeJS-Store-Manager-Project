# Store Manager Project

Tht was the second project that I developed with **Node.JS** to improve my **back-end** skills. 

If you compare this project with my [Talker Manager Project](https://github.com/VitBrandao/NodeJs-Talker-Manager-Project) you will notice that my application is way more organized (but not perfect yet), since the CRUD (create, read, update and read) operations are now divided in **Models**, **Services** and **Controllers**.

This project also required some **testing skills** - to be approved, I had to develop 40% of the application's test coverage by using **Jest, Mocha, Chai** and **Sinon**. You can find my tests by acessing the **test/unit** folder. 

The **frameworks** and **npm packages** that I combined with Node.JS in this project were: 
- **Express**;
- **Dotenv**;
- **mysql2**;
- **Mocha**;
- **Chai**;
- **Sinon**;
- **ESLint**.
